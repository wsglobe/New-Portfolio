          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software developer with a background in insurance sales and I specialize in building full-stack web
            applications
            primarily with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and MongoDB or MySQL. I studied at the University of Texas at Austin,
            where I
            earned my fullk-stack Web Development certification with high marks, and had the opportunity to create
            multiple projects
            and collaborate with team mates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since graduation, I've worked on personal projects to further strengthen my skills as a developer. When I'm
            not coding,
            you can find me keyaking on the Colorado River, gaming on my playStation, or cooking at home.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the short term, I'd love to be able to combine my work experience and the knowledge I'm gaining in full
            stack
            development today in a role that allows me to utilise my organizational experience, technical skills and
            creativity. In
            the long run, I want to be part of a business that serves a need in the society, working with great people
            and enjoying
            every moment of my work.
          </p>
